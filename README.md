# hello
This is a place to store ideas and personal projects

Hi,


I am a Python developer that struggled to learn how to code for five(5) years before I could get a job as a software developer intern. Now that I am an intern, I still struggle with a lot of tasks but I will never give up because I have always wanted to be a developer and I will. I am just learning how to use Github and this is a practice repository. 

Subsequent days, this repository will be a dumping ground for my personal project ideas and other readme files that I am cooking up. I hope my journey inspires you to never give up on yourself!

Thank you
